**A script for converting DSL format dictionaries compatible with GoldenDict to the Migaku Dictionary format**.
Useful for converting multilingual dictionaries. Written for the language learning community.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- **Converts DSL format dictionaries to JSON** tested for compatibility with the Migaku Dictionary Add-on for Anki.
- **Parses and sanitizes DSL tags** and replaces them appropriately for readability.
- Dictionary term and definition imports properly.

## üìñ Usage
In a working directory, <b><a href="https://github.com/lrorpilla/DSL2JSON/blob/main/DSL2JSON.py">download the script</a></b> and execute it with the command below in the same folder with the DSL file to convert as follows with <b><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</b></a>.
```
python3 DSL2JSON.py filename_of_dictionary_to_convert.dsl
```
* **Use of the script requires the **`chardet`** library to determine the encoding of the input file. The script will automatically download this file from PIP to facilitate ease of use. If the script does not work the first time, try running it again as the installation requires another startup of the script.**
* The script will output a **`DSL2JSON.zip`** file that can be imported with the **Install Dictionary From File** option in the Migaku Dictionary Settings menu. For more information, <b><a href="https://www.migaku.io/tools-guides/migaku-dictionary/manual/#installing-dictionaries">see the official guide on the Migaku add-on</a></b>.
* A **`DSL2JSON.json`** file is also left behind for debugging purposes should any escape character errors with the JSON occur.

## üöÄ Possible Extensions
- Improve script to recognize **altterm, pronunciation, parts of speech and example fields**.
- **Test script for reliability** on multiple dictionaries.
